[2026-02-14] #1 refactor: Add Orders projection, consolidate builder, add README
- Files: packages/domain/src/orders.ts (new), packages/domain/src/bootstrap.ts, packages/domain/src/index.ts, packages/domain/test/cart.spec.ts, packages/app/src/api/index.ts, packages/app/src/api/builder.ts (deleted), packages/app/src/server.ts, packages/app/src/dev-server.ts, README.md
- Changes: Replaced event-log-scanning listOrders with an Orders projection using Act's projection() builder and in-memory read model. Consolidated duplicated app builder from app package into domain bootstrap. Added README.
- Decisions: Used projection() builder with in-memory Map instead of a state aggregate — projections are side-effect handlers that update external read models, not per-stream aggregates. Auto-drain committed handler lives in app layer (api/index.ts) to avoid race conditions in domain tests.
- Issues: None

[2026-02-18] #3 refactor: Refactor Inventory from aggregate to projection with stock tracking
- Files: packages/domain/src/schemas.ts, packages/domain/src/inventory.ts, packages/domain/src/bootstrap.ts, packages/domain/src/index.ts, packages/domain/test/cart.spec.ts, packages/app/src/api/index.ts, packages/app/src/dev-server.ts, packages/app/src/client/App.tsx
- Changes: Renamed InventoryUpdated→InventoryImported, added name/price/quantity fields. Created InventoryProjection subscribing to InventoryImported, InventoryAdjusted, InventoryDecommissioned, CartPublished. Three inventory actions: ImportInventory (seeding), AdjustInventory (admin stock), DecommissionInventory (remove product). Fixed SubmitCart drain loop to ensure projections process CartPublished before response. Added cart quantity controls (+/- buttons, items grouped by product).
- Decisions: ImportInventory for seeding; AdjustInventory for admin; DecommissionInventory removes from projection (re-importable). SubmitCart uses drainAll loop (up to 5 rounds) to fully process reactions + projections. Cart drawer groups items by productId with quantity controls instead of individual line items.
- Issues: None

[2026-02-19] #5 refactor: Refactor client from single-file App.tsx into modular component architecture
- Files: packages/app/src/client/App.tsx (rewritten), types.ts (new), data/products.ts (new), hooks/{useCart,useEventStream,useToast,useActivityTracker,usePlaceOrder}.ts (new), components/{Header,SubNav,ProductCard,PriceDisplay,CartDrawer,EventPanel,Toast,JsonHighlight}.tsx (new), views/{ShopView,OrdersView,AdminView,MarketingView}.tsx (new), styles/{global,layout,products,cart,events,orders,admin,marketing}.css (new)
- Changes: Decomposed 2,100-line monolithic App.tsx into modular architecture: types, data, 5 hooks, 8 components, 4 views, and 8 CSS files. App.tsx reduced to 97 lines (providers + layout + hook composition). CSS migrated from JS template literal to proper .css imports.
- Decisions: Kept CSS as plain .css files (not CSS Modules) since class names are already unique/scoped by convention. Created usePlaceOrder hook to encapsulate order mutation logic and keep App.tsx under 100 lines. ShopView manages its own addingProduct state and activity tracking for add-to-cart.
- Issues: None
