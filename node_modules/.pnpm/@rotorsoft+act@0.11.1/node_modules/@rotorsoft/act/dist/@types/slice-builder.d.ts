/**
 * Creates a new slice builder for composing partial states with scoped reactions.
 *
 * Slices enable vertical slice architecture by grouping related states and
 * reactions into self-contained feature modules. Reactions defined in a slice
 * are type-scoped to events from that slice's states only.
 *
 * Include all states whose actions your handlers dispatch via `.with()`.
 * When multiple slices share the same state, duplicates are merged
 * automatically at `act().with(slice)` composition time.
 *
 * @example Single-state slice with typed dispatch
 * ```typescript
 * const CounterSlice = slice()
 *   .with(Counter)
 *   .on("Incremented")
 *     .do(async (event, _stream, app) => {
 *       await app.do("reset", target, {});
 *     })
 *     .void()
 *   .build();
 * ```
 *
 * @example Cross-state dispatch (include both states)
 * ```typescript
 * const CreationSlice = slice()
 *   .with(TicketCreation)
 *   .with(TicketOperations) // handler can dispatch AssignTicket
 *   .on("TicketOpened").do(async (event, _stream, app) => {
 *     await app.do("AssignTicket", target, payload, event);
 *   })
 *   .build();
 * ```

 * @see {@link Slice} for the output type
